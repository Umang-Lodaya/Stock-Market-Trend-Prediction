# **[STOCK MARK TREND PREDICTION](https://umang-lodaya-stock-market-trend-prediction.streamlit.app/)**

In this project, I utilized deep learning techniques to forecast the future trends of a time series dataset. The dataset was related to a business' sales performance over time, and I aimed to predict future sales based on past sales data.

I began by preprocessing the data, which involved cleaning, scaling, and transforming the data into a suitable format for deep learning algorithms. Next, I trained and evaluated various deep learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolution Neural Networks (CNN).

Our results indicated that the LSTM model outperformed other models, achieving a high level of accuracy and demonstrating its ability to capture the long-term dependencies and patterns in the data. Furthermore, I used a sliding window approach to predict future sales and compared our predictions with actual sales data.

Overall, our project demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning models for time series forecasting tasks. I successfully forecasted future sales trends, which can provide valuable insights for businesses in making informed decisions and planning for the future.
